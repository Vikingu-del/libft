# Libft

The `libft` (short for "library functions") repository is a collection of essential C functions commonly used in programming projects. This library provides a robust foundation for C developers, offering a set of handcrafted functions designed to streamline development and enhance code readability and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Standard Functionality:** Includes re-implementations of standard C library functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and more, providing a deeper understanding of their workings and allowing for customization where needed.
  
- **Additional Utilities:** Extends beyond standard functions to include various utility functions, data structure implementations, and algorithms commonly used in C programming tasks.
  
- **Well-tested:** Each function is thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and correctness, with a suite of test cases covering various scenarios and edge cases.
  
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for seamless integration into projects, with a clear and consistent naming convention and intuitive function signatures.
  
- **Portable:** Compatible with different platforms and compilers, ensuring versatility and ease of use across different environments.
